    <p>Dilu Nicholas began with book cover design. He has many years of experience working with publishers and authors to create eye-catching designs to represent their titles. People will ultimately buy a book that has a story or subject that they are interested in, but the first step is to get them to pick the book up off the shelf (or click on it) to find out what it’s about. His goal with book cover design is to come up with a concept that is complimentary to the title and geared towards the target audience so potential readers will be interested enough to learn more. He has worked with authors and publishers nationally and around the world to find ways to encourage people to look closer and see if what is between the covers is something they would be interested in.</p>

    <p>While it may be true that companies are turning more and more to digital means for promoting themselves and their services, printed materials still have an important place in the marketing strategies of many businesses. Business cards, letterhead and envelopes are a must-have for any company, and brochures, flyers, postcards and sell sheets continue to play a critical role in communicating capabilities and detailed information to potential customers. Print also extends beyond paper to any number of promotional items such as t-shirts, hats, pens, signs and much more. Dilu has much experience in all aspects of print design and can help you choose the best materials and methods to get your message out in the physical world.</p>

    <p>Logo design is a very important part of establishing your company identity. A logo should represent the style and personality of your company and appeal to your target market. Dilu has worked with many clients over the years to design and develop unique and effective logos that attract new customers and help create a sense of stability and professionalism. A logo is most effective when it is utilized and supported by all of your other marketing materials — creating a cohesive brand that will be instantly recognizable to anyone who sees your advertisements, vehicles, brochures or other promotional items. He can also help you evaluate your existing logo to see if it can be improved, redesigned, or rebuilt to better serve you in today’s high definition marketplace.</p>

By using tools like responsive design and content management systems, he will help you ensure that your site will look great on desktop and mobile devices, and that you can quickly and easily add content to keep your site up-to-date and ranking high.</p>
