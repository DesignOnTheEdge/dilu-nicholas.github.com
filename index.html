<h3>2013 P.A.I.N.T. Project - Parkland Rising</h3>

<p>A solution to vacant and abandoned properties in Louisville’s neighborhoods is to turn them into symbols of hope, renewal, and rebirth. This is happening in West Louisville’s Parkland neighborhood. Center For Neighborhoods P.A.I.N.T. (Producing Art in Neighborhoods Together) program selected local artist, Ramona Dallum Lindsey, to transform a vacant 2 story apartment building at 3201 Greenwood Ave. Parkland Rising will stand as a testament to public art, achievable when a community combines its talent, resources and energy to create positive changes.  The project is facilitated through Center for Neighborhood by a Metro External Agency grant.</p>

<p>Parkland Rising is more than an art project, it seeks to unite a community around the common goals of neighborhood improvement and environmental stewardship.  Symbolizing the community rising together to reclaim its place as a prominent Louisville neighborhood, the design includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A 12ft tall Phoenix with a 16ft wingspan made of over 2,000 recycled plastic bottles and old bed sheets.</li>
	<li>500 stickers attesting to the hopes and dreams for Parkland by its current and former residents.</li>
	<li>8 historical container gardens featuring ceramic tiles commemorating Parkland’s former glory.</li><br>
</ul>

<h3>Stay tuned for information about upcoming P.A.I.N.T. projects in 2014!</h3><br>
